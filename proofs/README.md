# proofs/ — the F\* model of the DAG fold

**Status: GO** (Phase 131, 2026-09-12). All three exit criteria met — the confluence proof is
reproducible on the pinned prover, the extracted model agrees with production over every lane set
the differential host draws, and the model reads beside the F# in one sitting. The decoder-totality
theorem is the next phase, in F\*.

This directory is the mechanised half of the correctness story whose differential half already
existed: Phase 80 certified two-script confluence, Phase 83 the two-head `Dag.reconcile`, Phase 100
the N-lane fold-confluence pack. Those are property tests over sampled orders; this is the same law
as a theorem, and the theorem's model run as a sixth host through the same differential test.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `DagFold.fst` | The model: `Ops.independent`, `Dag.conflicts`, `Dag.reconcileMany`, the replay and `FoldConfluence.foldOnce`, over an abstract `op`/`state`/`rej`, with `fold_confluence` proved. Every definition names its F# counterpart. |
| `oracle/DagFold.fs` | **Generated** — the model extracted to F# by F\*'s own code generator. The suite runs it beside production. |
| `oracle/Prims.fs` | Sixteen lines: the `Prims` names the F# backend emits and the release does not ship. |
| `oracle/Fuaran.Core.Proofs.Oracle.fsproj` | The oracle assembly. Never packed; nothing extracted enters the shipped kernel. |
| `fstar-pin.json` | The pinned F\* release (which bundles Z3) and its hash. |
| `check.ps1` | The proof leg: check with the pin, re-extract and diff against the committed oracle, run the host. |
| `../tests/Fuaran.Core.Tests/ProofOracleTests.fs` | The differential host (`Proofs.Oracle`), and the family that measures the theorem's hypothesis on the reference witness. |

## The theorem

`fold_confluence` (the last definition in `DagFold.fst`): for every lane set `ls1` and every
re-arrangement `ls2` of it — any two lists related by the inductive permutation relation `perm`,
Coq's `Permutation` — and every base state, `fold_once ls1` and `fold_once ls2` are **equivalent
outcomes**:

- both fold, to the **same state** (propositional equality, not a hash); or
- both halt, with the **same canonical report** — the same set of (shape, address, unordered op
  pair), which is exactly what `FoldConfluence.canonicalConflictReport` renders.

No lane set folds under one order and halts under another. The proof is by induction on the
permutation derivation, in two halves: the halt report is a permutation invariant of the pairwise
sweep (`all_conflicts_perm`), and a conflict-free set replays identically under any order
(`replay_perm`), with the lemma that `Dag.conflicts` is empty **iff** every cross-lane pair is
`Ops.independent` (`conflicts_nil_independent`, both directions — the Phase 64/83 cross-validation
promise, mechanised) joining the two.

**The one domain hypothesis** is `independence_diamond`: for this domain, two ops whose footprints
`independent` declares disjoint and which **both apply** at a state each apply after the other and
reach the same state. That is the domain's promise, and it is exactly the promise a shipped witness
certifies — Phase 78/80 for the tree algebra by sampling, Phase 100 for a domain's own witness by
sampling. Nothing proves it; everything in the fold half rests on it; and the `Proofs.Oracle`
family now **measures it on the reference tree witness**, so the hypothesis is not merely stated
about the domain it names.

The fold half asks one thing more, and it is a statement about the lane set in hand rather than a
promise about the domain: `lanes_apply` — every lane applies cleanly from the base state. That is
the lane set `foldOnce`'s generators produce, and it is the set the fold half was always about. A
lane set with a **rejecting** lane is outside the fold claim, exactly as it is outside Phase 80's;
`outcome_equiv` still has a both-rejected arm, and the theorem simply says nothing about when it is
taken. **The halt half asks for neither** — `fold_confluence_halt` is stated and proved with no
hypothesis about `apply` at all, because whether a lane set halts and what it halts with are
properties of the footprints alone.

_(Phase 131 stated the hypothesis as `independence_sound`: independent ops commute at every state,
**rejections included**. That premise is false of the reference witness — `Rejection.UnknownNode`
carries `addressable`, the whole id set of the tree it was raised against — so the theorem was
sound about a domain nobody has. Phase 132 replaced it with what the algebra keeps. See the claims
ladder's "not claimed" entry, and the `Proofs.Oracle` case that holds the refuting witness.)_

`--report_assumes error` is on: the module carries no `assume`, no `admit`, no `assume val`.

## What the corpus covers

The differential host draws lane sets from three pools and compares, per lane set and per sampled
arrival order, the outcome (folded hash / canonical halt report / rejection) and the merge script
(the composed op sequence) of production — `Dag.reconcileMany` through a real DAG, rendered as
`FoldConfluence.foldOnce` renders it — against the extracted model fed the lane deltas directly:

| Pool | Lanes | Trials | Both classes exercised |
|---|---|---|---|
| the reference tree witness (Phase 100's generator) | 3 and 4 | 120 + 60, all orders | yes (asserted) |
| the work-plan domain (Map state, its own footprint) | 3 and 5 | 150 + 40 (5 lanes: 24 sampled orders) | yes (asserted) |
| the wire corpus's `ops/` fixtures, projected to footprints | every pair and triple, plus two-op lanes | ~1.8k lane sets × all orders | yes (asserted) |

On the two domain pools the host also asserts the theorem's instance on the extracted code: the
oracle's own outcomes across all sampled orders are one outcome. The go-red case hands the oracle
a blind footprint and requires the comparison to fail and shrink to two lanes of one op, so a green
report is known to be a comparison that can lose.

**And the theorem's HYPOTHESIS is measured, not only stated.** Over the same generator, for every
op pair the model's own `independent` declares disjoint and every state where both ops apply, the
host checks the diamond directly on the tree `apply`: each applies after the other, and the two
orders reach the same tree. A sample-adequacy guard reports how many (pair, state) triples actually
met the premise, because a run that never met it measures nothing; a blind footprint must break the
same sample, so this measurement too is known to be one that can lose. A third case holds the
witness that the **stronger** clause is unavailable here: two footprint-independent inserts, one
under an absent parent, reject in both orders with *different* `UnknownNode` envelopes — which is
the claims-ladder entry below, as an assertion that goes red if the algebra ever changes back.

## The gap between model and production — the claims ladder

What may be said, and at what strength, per the attested-stack programme's §6:

1. **Proved (machine-checked, no admits).** On the model, for every N and every permutation:
   the fold-confluence law above — the fold half under `independence_diamond` for a lane set whose
   lanes all apply from the base state, the halt half under nothing at all. F\* 2026.09.06,
   Z3 4.13.3, every query 3/3 under `--quake 3`, cold-cache checks on three seeds and at a quarter
   of the rlimit the leg runs with.
2. **Differentially tested.** Production's `betweenOps` recovery of each lane's delta from a
   content-addressed DAG, its pairwise `conflicts` sweep, `reconcileMany`'s composition and
   `foldOnce`'s replay and rendering together agree with the extracted model, over the pools
   above. Agreement is over sampled lane sets and the `arrivalOrders` sample (exhaustive to 4
   lanes, 24 orders above), never over all inputs.
3. **Assumed, and stated as such.**
   - `independence_diamond` — the domain's promise, and the only domain hypothesis the theorem
     carries. Independent ops that **both apply** at a state each apply after the other and reach
     the same state. This is Phase 80's law and no more than it: interleaving totality (accepted
     scripts stay accepted) plus confluence, at op granularity. It is **sampled**, never proved —
     Phase 80 for the tree algebra, Phase 100 for a domain's own witness, and the `Proofs.Oracle`
     diamond family for the reference witness directly against the extracted model's own
     `independent`. Sampling is what this level means.
   - **The lane set is assumed to apply.** The fold half is stated for a lane set whose every lane
     applies cleanly from the base state (`lanes_apply`), which is what `foldOnce`'s generators
     produce and what the differential host draws. Nothing is proved about a lane set one of whose
     lanes rejects; the halt half still covers it whenever it halts.
   - **The DAG is outside the model.** Node ids, hashing, `mergeBase`, the topological order that
     recovers a delta — the model starts where the lane deltas are known. Level 2 is the only
     evidence about them.
   - **The extractor and the F# compiler are trusted.** The proof leg holds the committed oracle
     to a fresh extraction byte for byte, which makes "the oracle is the model" a checked claim;
     it does not make the F# backend correct. The backend is second-class upstream (findings
     below), and this is the least-examined link in the chain.
   - **Sets are lists.** The model reads F#'s `Set<string>` as lists under membership; the
     host compares canonical (deduplicated, sorted) reports, never raw conflict lists, so
     multiplicity and order in the model's reports are unobserved by construction.
4. **Not claimed.**
   - **Rejection identity.** That two independent ops, one of which rejects, reject *identically*
     whichever ran first. The reference algebra cannot keep it and the theorem no longer asks for
     it: `Rejection.UnknownNode` carries `addressable` — the whole id set of the tree it was raised
     against — and `ReorderMismatch` carries the parent's current children, so an op that rejects
     at `s` rejects with a **different envelope** after an independent op has inserted a node. Both
     orders reject; they do not reject identically. Phase 131's `independence_sound` demanded this
     clause, which made the theorem sound about a domain no shipped witness is; Phase 132 dropped
     it, and a `Proofs.Oracle` case holds the refuting witness so the sentence goes red if the
     algebra ever changes back.

   Also not claimed: anything about the linear `OpStream`, about `Dag.replayTo`'s order, about the
   engine's Lamport projection order (the roadmap engine's own certification of its fold over
   the real `RoadmapOp` union is roadmap-engine#343; this theorem is what makes its choice of
   total order canonical-form-only), or about any domain's reconciliation policy — the model,
   like production, decides nothing and applies nothing on a halt.

"Formally verified" is spent on level 1 alone.

## Exit criteria, with evidence

1. **Reproducible — met.** `check.ps1 -Runs 3` verifies the module three times from a cold
   cache with `--quake 3` (each query 3/3 over varying Z3 seeds); CI's `proofs` job runs exactly
   that on `windows-latest` on every push. Locally the module also checks at `--z3rlimit 10` (the
   leg uses 40) and under seeds 1, 2 and 3. There are no proof hints to commit, because the
   pinned release removed them (finding 1) — reproducibility rests on the pin, the seed sweep and
   the margin, not on a replay file.
2. **Agrees — met.** The `Proofs.Oracle` cases are green: no divergence over any pool, all
   three outcome classes exercised (folded and halted asserted non-vacuous; rejected covered by
   `LaneFoldOutcome` equality), and the merge script equal, not merely its hash. Since Phase 132
   the same family also measures the theorem's hypothesis on the reference witness, with its own
   adequacy guard and its own go-red.
3. **Readable — met.** `DagFold.fst` is ~790 lines with its commentary; the model half (sections
   0–4, everything the oracle is extracted from) is under 300 of them, and every definition is
   captioned with its F# counterpart. The one structural difference a reviewer meets is
   lists-for-sets, stated once at the top.

## Findings — the F\* bet, measured

The phase called the choice of F\* an untested bet and asked for the backend's quality as a finding
either way. What was found, in the order it was hit:

1. **Proof hints no longer exist.** F\* 2026.09.06 (and the releases since the change) has
   removed `--record_hints` / `--use_hints` / `--hint_dir` outright — `.hints` files are neither
   read nor written, and Z3 is no longer asked for unsat cores. The phase's "check from committed
   hints" cannot be done on any current release. `--quake N` (repeat each query N times over
   varying seeds) is the robustness tool that remains, and `--ext context_pruning` is what
   upstream names as the successor for hint-style pruning. The pin is therefore load-bearing:
   F\* releases **weekly**, and a floating prover is a gate that changes under you.
2. **The F# backend ships no runtime.** `--codegen FSharp` emits code referencing `Prims.list`,
   `Prims.string`, `Prims.bool` and `Prims.op_Equals`, and the release carries an OCaml `ulib`
   only. Sixteen lines of aliases (`oracle/Prims.fs`) close it for a model that keeps its list
   helpers self-contained; a model leaning on `FStar.List.Tot` would need each used function
   ported by hand.
3. **The emitted layout is pre-F#-8.** Match arms sit at column 1 inside a parenthesised lambda,
   which F# 10's strict indentation rejects as an error. The oracle project compiles with
   `--strict-indentation-` and `FS0058` silenced, for that project only.
4. **A ghost inductive extracts unless told not to.** The `perm` relation extracted as a DU with
   `obj` index parameters — legal F#, dead code. `[@@ noextract_to "FSharp"]` on the type keeps
   it out; lemmas are erased on their own.
5. **Extraction needs a checked module first.** `--codegen` on an unchecked file refuses with
   "cross-module inlining expects all modules to be checked"; the leg checks with
   `--cache_checked_modules` and extracts from the cache.
6. **The proof itself was cheap.** The model verifies in under three seconds; the two proof
   iterations needed were an implicit type parameter on the indexed `perm` type (made explicit)
   and a `forall_intro_2` whose predicate F\* could not infer inline (a named helper lemma). No
   rlimit tuning, no tactics, no SMT patterns beyond the membership algebra.

On the operator's familiarity argument — an ML-family model of an ML-family kernel — the finding is
that it held: the model is the F# with `Set` spelled as `list` and `Result` spelled as `outcome`,
and the extracted F# is legible enough to diff against the source by eye. The cost landed on the
backend's edges (findings 2–4), each closed in a few lines, not on the modelling.

## Running it

```powershell
pwsh ./proofs/check.ps1            # check (once), re-extract + diff, run the oracle host
pwsh ./proofs/check.ps1 -Runs 3    # what CI runs
pwsh ./proofs/check.ps1 -Extract   # after editing DagFold.fst: rewrite oracle/DagFold.fs, then commit it
pwsh ./verify.ps1 -Proofs          # the whole repo gate plus the proof leg
```

The first run downloads the pinned release (~200 MB, hash-verified) into `proofs/.fstar/`;
`FSTAR_HOME` pointing at a matching release skips that. Editing `DagFold.fst` without
re-extracting fails the leg with "oracle drift" — that is the point, not an inconvenience.

## Next

Theorem 1 of the programme's WS6.1 — decoder totality — as a hand-written F\* model of the decode
combinators over an abstract JSON value (the Fuaran wire is JSON with a kind-tag discipline, so this
is not an EverParse artefact). Theorem 3, interpreter budget monotonicity, is `fuaran-program`'s and
follows the same shape now that the prover is settled.
